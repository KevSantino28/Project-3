# Baseball Stadiums Data Visualization

## Overview

This project utilizes data visualizations to tell a story about baseball stadiums. It includes an interactive map with baseball icons representing different stadiums. The data is stored in CSV files, and visualizations are powered by Python and JavaScript libraries.

This project visualizes the locations of basketball stadiums, categorizing them into Major League Baseball (MLB) and Minor League Baseball (MiLB) stadiums. It uses Leaflet for mapping and D3 for data manipulation.

Additionally, the project includes a Python script for analyzing and visualizing team wins over the years, using linear regression to show trends.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/basketball-stadiums.git

2 Install the required dependencies:
  bash
  Copy code
  pip install -r requirements.txt
3.Open index.html in your browser to view the basketball stadiums map.
  Run the Python script analyze_wins.py to visualize team wins over the years.
  
## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

*     static/: Contains static files, including CSS styles and JavaScript code.
*     data/: Contains CSV files for MLB and MiLB stadiums.
*     analyze_wins.py: Python script for analyzing and visualizing team wins.
  
## Leaflet Map

The basketball stadiums are visualized using Leaflet, a JavaScript library for interactive maps. Custom icons are used to represent the locations of MLB and MiLB stadiums.

## Linear Regression Analysis

The Python script analyze_wins.py analyzes and visualizes team wins over the years using linear regression. It utilizes Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, SciPy, and ipywidgets.

## Dependencies

- Leaflet: [https://leafletjs.com/](https://leafletjs.com/)
- D3.js: [https://d3js.org/](https://d3js.org/)
- FontAwesome: [https://fontawesome.com/](https://fontawesome.com/)
- Python Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scipy, ipywidgets

## How to Use

1.Open index.html in a web browser to view the basketball stadiums map.
2.Run analyze_wins.py to perform linear regression analysis on team wins.
